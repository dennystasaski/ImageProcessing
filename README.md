# Image Processing

Simple Python script that merges a series of imperfect pictures to fix common saturation and exposure issues.

## Use

The following displays an image with varying levels of exposure:

![exposure demo](exposure-demo.jpg?raw=true)

When presented with several images of the same object like the above, the script will merge the images into one. The output of the script will be similar to the image in the center -- without saturation or exposure issues.

## To Run

To run, please make sure your computer has a webcam connected.  Then execute the following:

```
chmod +x ImageProcessing.py
python3 ImageProcessing.py
```
